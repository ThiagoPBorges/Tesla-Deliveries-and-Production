What is the growth rate of Tesla production and deliveries over the years?

Does Tesla manage to deliver everything it produces? Is there a gap between production and deliveries? Is this gap increasing or decreasing?

Is there any seasonality?

Based on historical data, could we make a simple forecast for the next few quarters?
